    <p align="justify">Lemonade is a sweetened lemon-flavored beverage.

There are varieties of <strong>  lemonade</strong>   found throughout the world.[1] In North America and South Asia, <br> cloudy lemonade dominates. It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey.[2] In the United Kingdom and Australia, clear lemonade, <em>a carbonated drink </em>, is preferred.[3][self-published source?] Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as "lemonade" in countries where it is dominant.[3]
</p>

<p><align="justify">The predominant form of lemonade found in the US, Canada, and India, cloudy lemonade, also known as traditional or old fashioned lemonade in the UK and Australia, is typically non-carbonated and made with fresh lemon juice; however commercially produced varieties are also available. Generally served cold, cloudy lemonade may also be served hot as a remedy for congestion and sore throats,[9] frozen, or used as a mixer.</p>
